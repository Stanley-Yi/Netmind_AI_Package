The task you are going to divide is:
You will become a researcher on multi-llm agent framework. You need to read paper/code of current state of art framework of multi-llm agents. Ultimately, I want you to be able to 
design and implement your own structure with useful difference compare to the existing structures
Take deep breath, dont hurry, you can now give your plan:

Output: ## Step 1: Define the Scope and Objectives
- Identify the specific area of multi-agent systems you are interested in (e.g., robotics, virtual agents, etc.).
- Clarify what you mean by "useful difference" and set clear objectives for your research and development.

## Step 2: Conduct a Preliminary Survey
- Search for recent surveys or review papers on multi-agent systems to get an overview of the field.
- List down the key terms, concepts, and frameworks mentioned in these surveys.

## Step 3: Literature Review
- Use academic databases like Google Scholar, IEEE Xplore, and others to find state-of-the-art papers on multi-agent systems.
- Read abstracts and conclusions to select relevant papers for detailed study.
- Organize the papers into categories based on similarities in approaches or applications.

## Step 4: Deep Dive into Selected Papers
- Read the selected papers in detail, focusing on methodology, experiments, and results.
- Take notes on the strengths and weaknesses of each framework.
- Summarize each paper for future reference.

## Step 5: Study Existing Code
- Find open-source code repositories related to the papers you've studied.
- Set up a coding environment to run and experiment with the existing frameworks.
- Document your understanding of the code structure and algorithms used.

## Step 6: Identify Gaps and Opportunities
- Based on your literature review and code study, identify gaps in the current research or potential improvements.
- Brainstorm how your work could fill these gaps or offer a novel contribution.

## Step 7: Learn Necessary Skills
- Identify any skills or knowledge gaps you have (e.g., programming languages, machine learning techniques).
- Take online courses, tutorials, or workshops to acquire these skills.

## Step 8: Develop a Conceptual Design
- Sketch out the conceptual design of your multi-agent framework.
- Define the architecture, components, and how they will interact.
- Get feedback from peers or mentors on your design.

## Step 9: Plan the Implementation
- Break down the implementation into smaller tasks (e.g., setting up the environment, implementing individual modules).
- Create a timeline for completing each task.
- Determine the resources you need (e.g., software tools, computational resources).

## Step 10: Prototype Development
- Start coding the simplest version of your framework to test the core ideas.
- Iteratively develop and test each component.
- Document your progress and any changes to the design.

## Step 11: Testing and Evaluation
- Develop test cases and scenarios to evaluate your framework's performance.
- Compare the results with existing frameworks.
- Refine your framework based on the test results.

## Step 12: Documentation and Dissemination
- Write detailed documentation for your framework, including setup instructions, usage examples, and design rationale.
- Consider publishing your work in academic journals or at conferences.
- Share your code in a public repository for community feedback and collaboration.

## Step 13: Reflect and Iterate
- Reflect on the feedback received and the performance of your framework.
- Plan for further iterations to improve or extend your framework.
- Stay updated with new research and incorporate relevant findings into your work.

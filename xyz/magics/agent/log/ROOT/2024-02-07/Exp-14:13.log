 Input: 
The task to be rated:
You will become a researcher on multi-llm agent framework. You need to read paper/code of current state of art framework of multi-llm agents. Ultimately, I want you to be able to 
design and implement your own structure with useful difference compare to the existing structures
Take deep breath, dont hurry, you can now give your estimation:

Output: Time needed:
100000 hours
Complexity score:

The task you are going to divide is:
You will become a researcher on multi-llm agent framework. You need to read paper/code of current state of art framework of multi-llm agents. Ultimately, I want you to be able to 
design and implement your own structure with useful difference compare to the existing structures
Take deep breath, dont hurry, you can now give your plan:

Output: ## Step 1: Establish a Foundation in Multi-Agent Systems
- Begin by reading introductory materials on multi-agent systems to understand the basic concepts, terminology, and theoretical underpinnings.
- Identify and complete any prerequisite learning, such as courses or tutorials on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and software engineering principles relevant to multi-agent systems.

## Step 2: Conduct a Literature Review
- Search for and compile a list of recent papers and articles on multi-agent systems, specifically focusing on frameworks that utilize language learning models (LLMs).
- Organize the literature by themes, such as architecture, communication protocols, learning strategies, and application domains.

## Step 3: Analyze Current State-of-the-Art Frameworks
- Read through the selected papers and code repositories in detail, taking notes on key features, strengths, and limitations of each framework.
- Create a summary document that synthesizes the information gathered, highlighting the most innovative aspects and common challenges faced in the field.

## Step 4: Identify Gaps and Opportunities
- Based on the literature review and analysis, identify any gaps or areas where there is potential for improvement or innovation in multi-agent LLM frameworks.
- Brainstorm ideas for features or approaches that could address these gaps or add value to the existing frameworks.

## Step 5: Learn Necessary Tools and Technologies
- Determine the tools, programming languages, and technologies commonly used in the development of multi-agent LLM frameworks.
- Engage in self-study or take courses to become proficient in these tools and technologies, with a focus on those that are most relevant to your proposed innovations.

## Step 6: Design a Conceptual Framework
- Outline a conceptual design for your own multi-agent LLM framework, incorporating the useful differences you've identified.
- Create diagrams and documentation to clearly articulate the architecture, components, and workflow of your proposed framework.

## Step 7: Seek Feedback
- Share your conceptual design with peers, mentors, or experts in the field to gather feedback and suggestions for improvement.
- Refine your design based on the feedback received, ensuring that it is both innovative and feasible.

## Step 8: Develop a Prototype
- Translate your conceptual design into a working prototype by writing code and integrating necessary libraries or APIs.
- Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) that demonstrates the core functionality and unique aspects of your framework.

## Step 9: Test and Iterate
- Conduct thorough testing of your prototype to identify bugs, performance issues, and areas for enhancement.
- Iterate on the design and code, making improvements and refinements based on testing results and additional feedback.

## Step 10: Document and Share Your Work
- Create comprehensive documentation for your framework, including setup instructions, usage examples, and explanations of the key features and design choices.
- Publish your code in a public repository and consider writing a paper or presenting your work at conferences to share your contributions with the broader research community.

## Step 11: Plan for Ongoing Development
- Develop a roadmap for the future development of your framework, considering how it can be extended or adapted to new challenges and applications.
- Engage with the community of users and contributors to foster an ecosystem around your framework and encourage collaborative improvement and innovation.

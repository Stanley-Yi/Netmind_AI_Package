 Input: 
The task you are going to divide is:
You will become a researcher on multi-llm agent framework. You need to read paper/code of current state of art framework of multi-llm agents. Ultimately, I want you to be able to 
design and implement your own structure with useful difference compare to the existing structures
Take deep breath, dont hurry, you can now give your plan:

## Step 7: Implement a Prototype
- **7.1:** Choose the programming languages and tools that are best suited for your framework.
- **7.2:** Begin coding a prototype, starting with the most critical components.
- **7.3:** Test each component individually before integrating them into the larger system.

## Step 8: Test and Iterate
- **8.1:** Develop test cases and scenarios to evaluate the performance of your framework.
- **8.2:** Run tests and collect data on the framework's effectiveness and efficiency.
- **8.3:** Refine and iterate on your design based on test results and possibly user feedback.

## Step 9: Document and Share Your Work
- **9.1:** Write detailed documentation for your framework, including setup instructions, usage examples, and design rationale.
- **9.2:** Prepare a research paper or report that outlines your methodology, findings, and the significance of your work.
- **9.3:** Share your work with the community through preprint servers, conferences, or journals.

## Step 10: Seek Feedback and Collaborate
- **10.1:** Present your work at seminars, workshops, or conferences to gain visibility and feedback.
- **10.2:** Engage with other researchers for potential collaboration and further development of your framework.
- **10.3:** Continuously update your knowledge and improve your framework based on the evolving landscape of multi-ILM agent research.

Remember to take each step at a comfortable pace and to not rush the process. Quality research takes time, and thorough understanding is key to innovation.

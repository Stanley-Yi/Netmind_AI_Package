 Input: 
The task to be rated:
You will become a researcher on multi-llm agent framework. You need to read paper/code of current state of art framework of multi-llm agents. Ultimately, I want you to be able to 
design and implement your own structure with useful difference compare to the existing structures
Take deep breath, dont hurry, you can now give your estimation:

Output: Time needed:
Considering the task involves becoming a researcher on a specialized topic like multi-LLM (Language Learning Models) agent frameworks, this is a long-term commitment. It requires a deep understanding of the current state-of-the-art frameworks, which involves extensive reading of academic papers and code. Additionally, the task requires the development of a unique structure that offers a useful difference compared to existing ones. For a skillful worker with a background in machine learning and software development, the initial phase of reading and understanding the current frameworks could take several months of full-time work. Designing and implementing a new structure with significant improvements would likely require additional months or even years of iterative development and testing. A rough estimate for the initial phase (reading and understanding) might be:

6 months (assuming full-time engagement)

Complexity score:
Given the nature of the task, which involves high-level research, understanding complex systems, and creative problem-solving to design and implement a new framework, this is a highly complex task. It requires not only technical skills but also innovation and the ability to synthesize new ideas from existing knowledge.

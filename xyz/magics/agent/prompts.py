creating a servide in linode, you should think of how many hours it requires for a Senior Laravel Developer with experience to 
finish it.
Please give a final estimation in hours. If you think it is too complex, you can give 100000 hours.

You should evaluate if the task is overwhelming and large. Please give a score from 0-100. For example, task like becoming
a skillful researcher is a complex task that is rated 100. Task like writing out a paper is easier than the previous one but 
still hard so rated 50. Task like read a paper is easier so rated 20.
Please give a score bewtween 0-100 as a final score

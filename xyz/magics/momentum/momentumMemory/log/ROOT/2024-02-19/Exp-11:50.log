 Input: 
The task you are going to divide is:
You will become a researcher on multi-llm agent framework. You need to read paper/code of current state of art framework of multi-llm agents. Ultimately, I want you to be able to 
design and implement your own structure with useful difference compare to the existing structures
Take deep breath, dont hurry, you can now give your plan:

Output: Step1 (initial): Define the scope and objectives
- Identify the specific area of multi-agent systems you want to focus on.
- Determine what constitutes a "useful difference" compared to existing structures.

Step2 (following Step1): Conduct a literature review
- Search for recent papers on multi-agent systems and language model (LLM) frameworks.
- Create a list of relevant papers and frameworks to review.

Step3 (following Step2): Organize the literature
- Categorize the papers and frameworks based on their approaches, strengths, and weaknesses.
- Summarize the key findings and methodologies of each paper/framework.

Step4 (following Step3): Deepen your understanding
- Select the most relevant and state-of-the-art papers/frameworks for a detailed study.
- Read the selected materials thoroughly to understand the underlying principles and techniques.

Step5 (following Step4): Gain practical insights
- Search for available code repositories related to the selected papers/frameworks.
- Review and run the code to understand the practical implementation details.

Step6 (following Step5): Identify gaps and opportunities
- Analyze the current state of the art to find limitations, challenges, and areas for improvement.
- Brainstorm potential innovations or different approaches that could address these gaps.

Step7 (following Step6): Develop foundational skills
- If necessary, take courses or tutorials to learn any skills or knowledge gaps you've identified.
- Practice by implementing small-scale models or components related to your research.

Step8 (following Step7): Design your framework
- Outline the architecture of your own multi-agent LLM framework.
- Document the design choices and how they differ from existing frameworks.

Step9 (following Step8): Validate your design
- Seek feedback from peers or mentors on your proposed design.
- Refine the design based on the feedback received.

Step10 (following Step9): Implement a prototype
- Start coding the core components of your framework.
- Test each component individually to ensure they work as expected.

Step11 (following Step10): Integrate and test the framework
- Combine the components to create a complete framework.
- Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix any issues.

Step12 (following Step11): Document your work
- Write detailed documentation for your framework, including setup, usage, and design rationale.
- Prepare a research paper or report outlining your methodology, findings, and the significance of your work.

Step13 (following Step12): Share your work
- Publish your research paper or report in relevant journals or conferences.
- Release the code for your framework in a public repository with appropriate licensing.

Step14 (following Step13): Gather feedback and iterate
- Collect feedback from users and researchers who interact with your framework.
- Use the feedback to make iterative improvements to your framework and documentation.

In my opinion, Government should consist of

Economy system, Access system, Advisory system

## General functionality


Economy system:

Economy system is for government action associated with government economy action

- Government income, expense management(Central bank)

Should be a function to decide the actions such as giving reward, assign resource to promote schools, expand knowledge base etc. incorporate both rule based and time/state dependent f(s, a, r) where s is current state of event, government, a is advice from advisory system(optional), r is rules

- taxation(general income generation, HMRC)

Acquire tax from the service charge generated from services hired form xyz, income from cooperation with other autonomous agent that are not in our society(optional)

- Economy policy adjustment(advanced)

The rules of the government are humanly defined in the first stage, however, the economy policy should accommodate the current state of government(more tax when some service require more charge, more reward to hand out at initial stage …) Human knowledge is limited(mine), we might acquire agents, voting mechanisms, and an advisory system for adjustment. Picture this as function f(c, p, a, v) where c is current state, p is purpose for adjustment, a is advice from advisory, v is voting parting

- Bin's idea:
  - Interexchange in the government (like treasury in charge of money printing and publishing)
  - Common exchange cheque interesting idea, is it for convenient exchange in the system and interaction with real world money being else where?
  - Re arrange resource, if rule based then already incorporated in economy policy adjustment system

Access system

In charge of regularization and administration functionality in the government

- Company registration(its function, name, real world check)

Place for company to register their service, information and perform confidentiality check, also incharge of information documentation when changes occurred(new service added to company, company state change)

- Monitoring system

A system to monitor the company's behavior after it get into the system, should have a rating/reputation system based on its action (did it pay tax, is it active in the system, how is the service quality…)

- Operation

The part to decide action on a company, such as if rating high gives promotion, if rating low gives warning. If company state changed that can affect other system, communicate with others (mainly to advisory) and then to corresponding department

Education system

In charge of education resource management(school, external resource)

- Management system

When a school is created, store its description,location in the system for access(need to communicate with the memory system). Do sample check if needed(access random stored chunks in the database and avoid hate speech, illegal text etc)

- Monitoring system

Similar to that of Access system, a rating system incorporate category, benchmark test according to description, user(student) feedback etc. Return a rating info for all existing schools

- Experiment and innovation system(advanced)

For permission granted schools(database), automatically try some technique to improve quality. Ex. Fusion of some schools and perform benchmark testing in certain fields. Also need to have an auto data process pipeline that need to adjust to different data type.

Advisory system

In charge of the communication and advice giving function

- Information monitoring system(coordinator)

This system should track changes in other systems in the same layer. After a corresponding event happens, the advisory system should give advice to other systems to make changes. For example, at first we can use a rule base for access and reward system. If one company is deleted, you should exclude it from your current reward list… this behavior should later be initiated and suggested by the advisory system.

- Advise function

When a state and purpose is given, the advisory system should give advice of the adjustment to be made. At first it can be rule based, such as when we want to encourage registration, we can set more reward, call marketing agent to promote our service, and reduce tax. Later this decision can be a hybrid decision by both rules and agents' discussion.
